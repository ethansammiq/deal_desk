# Role-Driven UI Consolidation & Experience Plan

## Current State Analysis

### **FRAGMENTATION ISSUES IDENTIFIED:**
1. **Dept Queues** - Separate dashboard for department-specific workload management
2. **SLA Monitor** - Isolated SLA tracking and deadline management  
3. **Priority Actions** (UnifiedDashboard) - Embedded priority banner with user-specific actions
4. **ApprovalWorkflowDashboard** - Separate component for approval pipeline visualization

**Result**: Users must navigate between multiple interfaces to get a complete picture of their work.

## **ROLE-BASED EXPERIENCE REQUIREMENTS**

### **👤 SELLER ROLE** - Deal Creator & Manager
**Primary Goals**: Submit deals, track progress, respond to feedback, manage drafts

**Current Experience Issues:**
- Priority Actions scattered across different pages
- No unified view of draft management + submission pipeline
- SLA information not relevant to their workflow

**Ideal Experience:**
- **Unified "My Deals" Dashboard** with integrated status tracking
- **Draft Management Hub** with auto-save, version control, submission pipeline
- **Progress Visibility** - clear pipeline status without approval complexity
- **Action-Focused** - prioritize "What do I need to do next?"

### **🔍 APPROVER ROLE** - Deal Reviewer & Decision Maker  
**Primary Goals**: Review submissions, approve/reject deals, manage review queue

**Current Experience Issues:**
- Need to check multiple places: UnifiedDashboard → Dept Queues → Individual deals
- SLA pressure not prominently featured in main workflow
- Priority items mixed with general deal list

**Ideal Experience:**
- **Review-Centric Dashboard** with priority queue front-and-center
- **Integrated SLA Alerts** within approval queue (not separate page)
- **Bulk Actions** for common approval patterns
- **Context-Rich Reviews** - all deal info + history in single view

### **⚖️ LEGAL ROLE** - Contract & Compliance Manager
**Primary Goals**: Legal review, contract drafting, compliance oversight

**Current Experience Issues:**  
- Generic priority actions not tailored to legal workflow
- No legal-specific SLA tracking (contract turn-around times)
- Missing contract pipeline visibility

**Ideal Experience:**
- **Contract Pipeline Dashboard** with legal-specific SLAs
- **Compliance Risk Alerts** integrated with deal reviews
- **Legal Document Management** with version control
- **Regulatory Deadline Tracking** (not general SLAs)

### **👨‍💼 ADMIN ROLE** - System Oversight & Management
**Primary Goals**: Monitor system performance, manage workflows, troubleshoot issues

**Current Experience Issues:**
- Need comprehensive view but currently fragmented across multiple dashboards
- SLA monitoring separate from operational metrics

**Ideal Experience:**
- **Executive Command Center** with system-wide metrics
- **Integrated Performance Dashboard** (SLA + workload + user metrics)
- **Exception Management** - deals needing intervention
- **System Health Monitoring** with automated alerts

### **🏢 DEPARTMENT_REVIEWER ROLE** - Specialized Review Functions
**Primary Goals**: Department-specific technical reviews (Trading, Finance, Creative, etc.)

**Current Experience Issues:**
- Generic approval interface doesn't surface department-specific context
- No workload balancing visibility within department

**Ideal Experience:**
- **Department Workbench** with specialized review tools
- **Technical Context Integration** (market data, financial models, creative assets)
- **Peer Collaboration** features for complex reviews
- **Workload Distribution** awareness within team

## **CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY**

### **🎯 PHASE 1: ROLE-ADAPTIVE UNIFIED DASHBOARD**

**Concept**: Single dashboard that dynamically adapts based on user role, surfacing relevant information and actions.

#### **Implementation Plan:**
1. **Create `RoleAdaptiveDashboard` Component**
   - Replace current UnifiedDashboard with role-aware version
   - Dynamically render sections based on `rolePermissions.dashboardSections`
   - Integrate Priority Actions, SLA Alerts, and Queue Management in single view

2. **Role-Specific Dashboard Sections:**
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced role permissions for dashboard layout
   dashboardSections: {
     seller: ["my-deals", "drafts", "status-tracking", "performance"],
     approver: ["review-queue", "sla-alerts", "approval-metrics", "team-performance"], 
     legal: ["contract-pipeline", "legal-queue", "compliance-alerts", "document-management"],
     admin: ["system-overview", "exception-management", "performance-metrics", "user-management"],
     department_reviewer: ["department-queue", "technical-reviews", "workload-distribution", "peer-collaboration"]
   }
   ```

3. **Consolidate Existing Components:**
   - **Priority Actions** → Embedded in role dashboard as primary action area
   - **Dept Queues** → Department-specific section for department_reviewer role
   - **SLA Monitor** → Alert system integrated across all roles (different priorities)
   - **ApprovalWorkflow** → Contextual component shown when relevant

### **🎯 PHASE 2: CONTEXTUAL ACTION CONSOLIDATION**

**Problem**: Actions scattered across multiple components with inconsistent interfaces.

#### **Solution: Unified Action System**
1. **Create `ContextualActionBar` Component**
   - Role-aware action suggestions
   - Priority-based action ordering
   - Bulk action capabilities where appropriate

2. **Action Context Intelligence:**
   ```typescript
   interface ContextualAction {
     id: string;
     label: string;
     priority: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
     deadline?: Date;
     context: string; // Why this action is needed
     role: UserRole[];
     component: 'inline' | 'modal' | 'redirect';
   }
   ```

### **🎯 PHASE 3: INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYNTHESIS**

**Problem**: Users get information overload from multiple data sources without clear prioritization.

#### **Solution: Smart Information Architecture**
1. **Create `IntelligentNotificationSystem`**
   - Cross-reference SLA data + Priority items + Workload metrics
   - Surface only actionable insights based on role and current context
   - Reduce notification fatigue with smart filtering

2. **Contextual Data Integration:**
   - **For Sellers**: Deal progress + revision feedback + next steps
   - **For Approvers**: Priority queue + SLA risks + performance impact
   - **For Legal**: Contract deadlines + compliance risks + regulatory updates
   - **For Admins**: System exceptions + performance trends + user issues

## **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH**

### **🔧 ARCHITECTURE CHANGES**

1. **Enhanced Role System:**
   ```typescript
   interface EnhancedRolePermissions extends RolePermissions {
     dashboardLayout: DashboardLayout;
     primaryActions: ActionType[];
     informationPriority: InfoPriorityConfig;
     workflowFocus: WorkflowStage[];
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Component Loading:**
   ```typescript
   const RoleAdaptiveDashboard = ({ userRole }) => {
     const layout = rolePermissions[userRole].dashboardLayout;
     return (
       <DashboardGrid layout={layout}>
         {layout.sections.map(section => 
           <DynamicSection key={section.id} type={section.type} config={section.config} />
         )}
       </DashboardGrid>
     );
   };
   ```

3. **Consolidated Data Layer:**
   - Single hook: `useRoleAdaptiveData(userRole)` 
   - Combines: deals, approvals, SLA data, priority items, workload metrics
   - Returns only relevant data for the user's role and context

### **🎨 UX IMPROVEMENTS**

1. **Progressive Information Disclosure:**
   - Show summary first, allow drilling down for details
   - Role-appropriate level of detail by default
   - Expandable sections for power users

2. **Action-Oriented Design:**
   - Prominent "Next Action" areas
   - Clear visual hierarchy: Critical → High → Medium → Low
   - Contextual help and reasoning for recommended actions

3. **Personalization:**
   - User-configurable dashboard sections (within role constraints)
   - Saved views and preferences
   - Learning system that adapts to user behavior patterns

## **RECOMMENDATION**

Start with **Phase 1: Role-Adaptive Unified Dashboard** focusing on the **Seller** and **Approver** roles first, as they represent 80% of daily users. This will provide immediate value while establishing the foundation for advanced role-specific experiences.

The key insight: instead of building separate tools for each concern (SLA, queues, priorities), build role-specific experiences that intelligently surface the right information at the right time for each user's workflow.
