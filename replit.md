- **Complete User Management**: Admin panel for role/department assignment, role testing interface with department_reviewer support
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Conditional access to admin features and testing tools based on user permissions
- **Consolidated Testing Interface**: Unified testing platform at `/testing` combining role switching, workflow testing, permission validation, and status transition testing. Legacy routes and components removed for cleaner codebase (August 2025)
- **Enhanced Permission System**: Removed approver edit permissions to enforce revision request workflow, clarified "View Deals" vs "View All Deals" distinction, improved testing interface with clear explanations (August 2025)
- **Role Consolidation**: Merged Legal role into Department Reviewer structure as legal department, added all 6 departments + legal to department selection, fixed role switching persistence (August 2025)
- **Streamlined Dashboard Experience**: Eliminated redundancy between top navigation and dashboard actions. Dashboard now focuses on urgent tasks and workflow-specific actions not covered by main navigation, reducing cognitive load and UI clutter (August 2025)
- **Enhanced Header Components**: Evolved notification bell with role-based visibility (hidden for sellers) and real data integration. Upgraded profile button to functional dropdown with role switching, admin access, and logout capability. Removed mock data in favor of authentic implementation patterns (August 2025)
- **Consolidated Dashboard Architecture**: Unified RoleBasedDashboard and UnifiedDashboard into single ConsolidatedDashboard component, eliminating redundancy and navigation confusion. Features shared metrics for reviewers/approvers, integrated approval queues into Action Items section, and enhanced deal table with Sales Channel and Region columns (August 2025)
- **Dedicated Deals Page Separation**: Created distinct DealsPage component to separate dashboard overview from comprehensive deal management. Homepage shows dashboard with recent deals preview, /deals shows full table with filtering, search, and detailed columns. Implemented consistent breadcrumb navigation and layout patterns across all pages (August 2025)
- **My Pipeline Implementation**: Completed Phase 1 (data association) and Phase 2 (component refactoring) for seller dashboard. Achieved ~70% code reuse through DealRow component and centralized metrics hooks. Fixed React hooks ordering issues for stable rendering. Phase 3 (Pipeline Section wrapper and Enhanced Action Items) pending completion (August 2025)
- **Strategic Insights Implementation**: Completed unified Strategic Insights framework across all roles (August 2025). Eliminated redundant Priority Action sections in favor of high-value Pipeline Health Intelligence (sellers) and Workflow Efficiency Intelligence (reviewers/approvers). Achieved consistent 3-section dashboard architecture: metrics, primary workflow, and strategic intelligence. Uses authentic data from dealStatusHistory, deals table, and approval workflows for actionable insights.
- **Phase 2A Enhanced Intelligence**: Implemented advanced strategic intelligence with predictive risk analysis, performance threshold monitoring, and process bottleneck detection (August 2025). Enhanced all insights with specific actionable guidance and contextual action labels. Insights now provide concrete next steps like "Contact client today" or "Block 2 hours to clear backlog" rather than vague suggestions.
- **Contextual Action Routing**: Redesigned Pipeline Health Intelligence to eliminate micro-page fragmentation (August 2025). Single deals route to individual deal pages (/deals/123), multiple deals use highlight parameters (/deals?highlight=123,456) for contextual focus. Fixed mobile navigation inconsistency by aligning mobile menu structure with desktop navigation, removing outdated "Deals" link.
- **Breadcrumb Navigation Enhancement**: Improved breadcrumb system with sessionStorage-based referrer tracking for Analytics navigation (August 2025). Core functionality implemented but wouter router limitations with query parameter preservation identified for future enhancement. Current system maintains navigation context through sessionStorage with fallback to default paths.
- **Ultra-Simplified Flow Intelligence System**: Streamlined to 2-status system (on_track, needs_attention) based on user feedback (August 2025). Combined "delayed" and "stalled" into unified "needs_attention" category to eliminate action overlap. Removed unused "accelerated" status to create clean, streamlined logic throughout the codebase. System now provides clear binary classification: deals either need attention or are progressing normally.
- **Streamlined Analytics UX**: Removed redundant Follow Up buttons and Eye icons from Analytics table, making entire rows clickable for navigation (August 2025). Added dedicated "Deal Insight" column displaying flow intelligence status with proper backend flowIntelligence field calculation. Eliminated action redundancy while maintaining clean, intuitive user experience focused on essential deal data.
- **Enhanced Draft Editing Experience**: Fixed critical draft editing flow with proper routing from deal details to submission form (August 2025). Edit Deal buttons now correctly navigate to `/request/proposal?draftId=ID` with pre-population functionality. Added distinct "Continue Draft" styling for better UX. Enhanced sample data with dedicated draft and scoping status examples for seller@company.com testing.
- **Complete DealFinancialSummary Migration**: Eliminated legacy financial calculation system entirely in favor of modern DealCalculationService architecture (August 2025). Removed deprecated interfaces, updated all components to use direct calculation methods, and fixed TypeScript errors. System now uses single source of truth for calculations with improved consistency between Step 3 financial tables and summary displays.
- **Unified Review Action Flow**: Implemented streamlined action system with single "Review" button across all Strategic Insights (August 2025). Single deals route to detail pages, multiple deals route to filtered analytics with specific "Follow Up" actions. Eliminated redundant action buttons and confusing multi-action interfaces for cleaner user experience.
- **Streamlined Seller Pipeline**: Redesigned My Pipeline section with focused two-tab structure: Active Deals (submitted deals in progress) and Upcoming Deals (drafts and scoping deals with clear action buttons). Removed redundant Recent Performance section and Create New Deal button to reduce cognitive load. Eliminated redundant visual highlighting since Pipeline Health Intelligence already provides actionable deal insights (August 2025).
- **Priority-Driven Strategic Insights**: Refactored Strategic Insights to use actual DealPriority type instead of custom urgency field for consistency across the application (August 2025). Enhanced seller filtering to exclude both 'draft' and 'scoping' status, added 'client_review' to external deals and 'submitted' to internal deals, implemented separate handling for 'revision_requested' status with specific action guidance. Removed redundant 'Pipeline Needs Activation' insight as sellers should follow up internally on stalled submissions. Insights now use priority-based urgency levels matching the deal priority system.
- **Unified Risk Detection**: Aligned Strategic Insights with Deals at Risk metric by combining flowIntelligence timing detection with business risk criteria (August 2025). Strategic Insights now detects revision_requested status, high revision counts, and extended negotiations alongside timing-based flow issues. Removed draft expiring risk category per user request. This ensures comprehensive actionable intelligence and eliminates discrepancies between dashboard metrics and insights sections.
- **Simplified Multi-Department Approval Workflow**: Implemented streamlined approval system with core departments (finance, trading) that review ALL deals plus specialized departments assigned based on incentive mappings (August 2025). Features simplified 3-state approval system: pending, revision_requested, approved at the approval level. Eliminated "revision_requested" from core deal statuses - deals remain in "under_review" while approval complexity lives within the approval states system. Smart routing maps incentives to departments: product-innovation→creative, marketing→marketing, analytics→solutions, technology→product. System calculates deal-level approval states (pending_department_review, mixed_department_review, departments_approved, pending_business_approval, fully_approved) and manages Stage 2 business approval progression only after all relevant departments complete Stage 1. Clean deal progression: submitted → under_review → approved, with revision requests handled within approval workflow rather than as separate deal statuses.

### Technical Implementation & Design
The application features an Express.js backend with an in-memory storage solution, defining RESTful API endpoints for deal management. The frontend employs a component-based design with extensive use of reusable components and custom React hooks for encapsulating business logic.
