# Deal Desk Application

## Project Overview
A comprehensive deal desk application that leverages AI and advanced analytics to streamline commercial deal submission, approval tracking, and support request management.

**Core Technologies:**
- TypeScript for robust type checking
- Node.js and React for dynamic frontend
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Anthropic AI integration for intelligent deal assessment
- Standardized form components for consistent user experience

## Project Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **Express.js Server** (`server/index.ts`) - Main application entry point
- **Storage Layer** (`server/storage.ts`) - Handles data persistence with in-memory storage
- **AI Integration** (`server/anthropic.ts`) - Claude AI for deal analysis and recommendations
- **API Routes** (`server/routes.ts`) - RESTful endpoints for deal management
- **Database Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`) - Drizzle ORM schema definitions

### Frontend Structure
- **React with Wouter** for routing and state management
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for form validation
- **Shadcn/UI + Tailwind** for component library and styling
- **DealGenie Chatbot** for AI-powered user assistance

### Key Features
- Deal submission with tiered and flat commit structures
- Real-time AI analysis and recommendations
- Dashboard with deal tracking and statistics
- Intelligent chatbot for user guidance
- Comprehensive form validation and error handling

## Current Technical Debt Status

### ✅ Resolved Critical Issues
1. **Type Safety Problems** - ✅ Fixed all Dashboard component type errors (8 errors)
2. **Schema Mismatches** - ✅ Aligned frontend/backend data models  
3. **Storage Type Errors** - ✅ Fixed all 11 LSP diagnostics in storage layer
4. **Form Validation Issues** - ✅ Fixed SubmitDeal.tsx form schema errors

### ✅ Completed Improvements
- **Real Statistics** - Replaced mock stats with authentic database calculations
- **Type Safety** - Eliminated all 20 LSP diagnostic errors
- **Data Integrity** - Implemented proper null/undefined handling
- **Contract Term Calculation** - Auto-calculated from date ranges server-side

### ✅ Phase 1.1 Complete - Business Logic Extraction
- **DealCalculationService** - All financial calculation logic extracted
- **DataMappingService** - Deal name generation logic extracted
- **useDealCalculations** - React hook for seamless service integration
- **Zero LSP Errors** - Maintained error-free foundation throughout refactoring

### ✅ Phase 1.2 Complete - Form Section Component Extraction
- **BasicDealInfoSection** (461 lines) - ✅ Complete
- **ValueStructureSection** (360 lines) - ✅ Complete  
- **ReviewSubmitSection** (303 lines) - ✅ Complete
- **Zero LSP Diagnostics** - ✅ All type errors resolved
- **SubmitDeal.tsx reduced** from 3,999 to 3,936 lines (1,124 lines moved to components)

### Next Optimization Areas
- Phase 1.3: Create component library for repeated form patterns
- Phase 1.4: Extract remaining large sections (tier configuration, approval logic)
- Phase 2: Add comprehensive error boundaries and loading states
