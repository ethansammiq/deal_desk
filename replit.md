## System Architecture
The application features an Express.js backend with an in-memory storage solution, defining RESTful API endpoints for deal management. The frontend employs a component-based design with extensive use of reusable components and custom React hooks for encapsulating business logic. UI/UX emphasizes consistency through standardized form components, a clear functional layout, and consistent styling across all financial sections.

**Core Technologies:**
- **TypeScript**: For robust type checking.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **React**: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive styling.
- **Wouter**: Lightweight routing.
- **TanStack Query**: For efficient server state management.
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: For robust form validation and schema definition.
- **Shadcn/UI**: Component library for standardized UI elements.

**Key Architectural Decisions & Technical Implementations:**

- **Revision Request System**: Allows approvers to request specific changes with detailed feedback.
- **Advanced Collaboration Features**: Includes team communication via comments, guided status changes, and a comprehensive audit trail.
- **Unified Dashboard**: Consolidates all dashboard views into a single role-aware interface with dynamic action columns.
- **Component & Interface Consolidation**: Significant reduction in code redundancy through strategic consolidation, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
- **Enhanced Loss Tracking**: Comprehensive categorization system for deal losses.
- **Complete User Management**: Admin panel for role/department assignment and role testing.
- **Streamlined Dashboard Experience**: Focused on urgent tasks and workflow-specific actions, reducing UI clutter.
- **Enhanced Header Components**: Evolved notification bell and profile dropdown with role-based visibility and functionality.
- **Dedicated Deals Page Separation**: Distinct component for comprehensive deal management separate from the dashboard overview.
- **My Pipeline Implementation**: Seller dashboard with data association and component refactoring.
- **Strategic Insights Implementation**: Unified framework across all roles providing actionable intelligence with predictive risk analysis, performance threshold monitoring, and process bottleneck detection.
- **Contextual Action Routing**: Single deals route to individual deal pages, multiple deals use highlight parameters for contextual focus.
- **Ultra-Simplified Flow Intelligence System**: Streamlined to a 2-status system (on_track, needs_attention).
- **Streamlined Analytics UX**: Entire rows are clickable for navigation, with dedicated "Deal Insight" column.
- **Enhanced Draft Editing Experience**: Proper routing from deal details to submission form with pre-population.
- **Complete DealFinancialSummary Migration**: Utilizes modern DealCalculationService architecture.
- **Unified Review Action Flow**: Streamlined action system with a single "Review" button across all Strategic Insights.
- **Streamlined Seller Pipeline**: Redesigned My Pipeline section with focused two-tab structure.
- **Priority-Driven Strategic Insights**: Uses actual DealPriority type for consistency.
- **Unified Risk Detection**: Aligned Strategic Insights with Deals at Risk metric by combining flowIntelligence timing detection with business risk criteria.
- **Simplified Multi-Department Approval Workflow**: Streamlined approval system with core and specialized departments, managing approval states within the workflow rather than as separate deal statuses.

**Key Features:**
- **Deal Submission**: Supports both tiered and flat commit structures.
- **Real-time AI Analysis**: Provides intelligent insights and recommendations for deals.
- **Dashboard**: Offers real-time deal tracking and performance statistics.
