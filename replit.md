# Deal Desk Application

## Project Overview
A comprehensive deal desk application that leverages AI and advanced analytics to streamline commercial deal submission, approval tracking, and support request management.

**Core Technologies:**
- TypeScript for robust type checking
- Node.js and React for dynamic frontend
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Anthropic AI integration for intelligent deal assessment
- Standardized form components for consistent user experience

## Project Architecture

### Backend Structure
- **Express.js Server** (`server/index.ts`) - Main application entry point
- **Storage Layer** (`server/storage.ts`) - Handles data persistence with in-memory storage
- **AI Integration** (`server/anthropic.ts`) - Claude AI for deal analysis and recommendations
- **API Routes** (`server/routes.ts`) - RESTful endpoints for deal management
- **Database Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`) - Drizzle ORM schema definitions

### Frontend Structure
- **React with Wouter** for routing and state management
- **TanStack Query** for server state management
- **React Hook Form + Zod** for form validation
- **Shadcn/UI + Tailwind** for component library and styling
- **DealGenie Chatbot** for AI-powered user assistance

### Key Features
- Deal submission with tiered and flat commit structures
- Real-time AI analysis and recommendations
- Dashboard with deal tracking and statistics
- Intelligent chatbot for user guidance
- Comprehensive form validation and error handling

## Current Technical Debt Status

### ✅ Resolved Critical Issues
1. **Type Safety Problems** - ✅ Fixed all Dashboard component type errors (8 errors)
2. **Schema Mismatches** - ✅ Aligned frontend/backend data models  
3. **Storage Type Errors** - ✅ Fixed all 11 LSP diagnostics in storage layer
