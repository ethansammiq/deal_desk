# Draft Creation & Auto-Save Validation Guide

## **TC1.1.1 - Draft Creation Navigation** ✅

### **How to Create a Draft Deal:**

1. **Primary Navigation Path**:
   ```
   Top Navbar → "Deal Requests" → "Direct Submission" button
   URL Flow: / → /deal-requests → /submit-deal
   ```

2. **Alternative Navigation**:
   ```
   Dashboard → "New Deal" button (if available)
   Direct URL: /submit-deal
   ```

### **Draft Types Available**:
- **Scoping Draft**: Via "Deal Scoping Request" → `/request-support`
- **Submission Draft**: Via "Direct Submission" → `/submit-deal`

## **Auto-Save Functionality Testing** ✅

### **How Auto-Save Works**:

1. **Automatic Saves**:
   - Form data is auto-saved every **2 seconds** after changes
   - Data is saved to localStorage with key: `deal-submission-draft`
   - Toast notification appears: "Draft Auto-saved"

2. **Navigation Protection**:
   - Form data is automatically saved when navigating away
   - Browser `beforeunload` event triggers immediate save
   - No data loss when accidentally closing tab/browser

3. **Draft Recovery**:
   - When returning to `/submit-deal`, system detects saved draft
   - User gets confirmation dialog: "We found a saved draft..."
   - Selecting "OK" restores all form data
   - Toast notification: "Draft Loaded"

### **Testing Steps**:

```
Step 1: Navigate to Deal Creation
- Go to /deal-requests
- Click "Direct Submission" 
- Confirms navigation to /submit-deal ✓

Step 2: Test Auto-Save
- Fill in some form fields (Deal Name, Business Summary)
- Wait 2+ seconds  
- Look for "Draft Auto-saved" toast notification ✓

Step 3: Test Navigation Protection  
- Navigate away from form (go to /dashboard)
- Return to /submit-deal
- Confirm dialog asking to restore draft ✓

Step 4: Test Draft Recovery
- Select "OK" in confirmation dialog
- Verify all previous form data is restored ✓
- Confirm toast "Draft Loaded" appears ✓
```

## **Technical Implementation** 

### **useAutoSave Hook**:
```typescript
const autoSave = useAutoSave({
  data: form.getValues(),           // Form data to save
  storageKey: 'deal-submission-draft', // localStorage key
  enabled: true,                    // Auto-save enabled
  delay: 2000                      // 2-second delay
});
```

### **Features**:
- **Real-time saving**: Form changes trigger delayed auto-save
- **Immediate save**: Page unload triggers instant save
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback with user notifications
- **Data validation**: Only saves valid form data structures
- **User control**: Confirmation dialog for draft restoration

### **Storage Location**:
- **Primary**: Browser localStorage
- **Key**: `deal-submission-draft`
- **Backup**: Optional server-side draft API (commented out)
