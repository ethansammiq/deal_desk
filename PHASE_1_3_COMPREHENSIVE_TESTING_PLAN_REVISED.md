TC1.2.3 - Multiple Draft Management
• Create 3+ drafts with different client names
• Verify each shows correct client name in Priority Actions
• Test resuming different drafts maintains proper data separation
• Confirm no data cross-contamination between drafts
```

### 1.3 **Draft Data Validation & Field Separation**
**Test Objective**: Validate proper field handling between scoping and submission forms

**Test Cases**:
```
TC1.3.1 - GrowthAmbition Field Separation (CRITICAL FIX)
