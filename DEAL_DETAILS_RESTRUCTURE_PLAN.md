```

### Tablet (md): 2-Column Stacked
```
[60% Core Info] [40% Actions]
[100% Workflow & Collaboration Stacked]
```

### Mobile (sm): Single Column Priority Order
```
1. Deal Overview (condensed)
2. Quick Actions
3. Financial Performance (key metrics only)
4. Approval Progress
5. Comments (collapsed)
6. Full Details (expandable sections)
```

## Visual Design Principles

### Information Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Deal status, financial performance, urgent actions
2. **Secondary**: Approval progress, AI insights, team communication
3. **Tertiary**: Historical data, related information, advanced features

- **Green**: Positive metrics, approved items, completed actions
- **Blue**: Information, progress indicators, system status
- **Amber**: Warnings, pending items, attention needed
- **Red**: Errors, rejected items, critical issues
- **Purple**: AI insights, recommendations, strategic data

### Spacing & Typography
- **Cards**: 16px padding, 8px gap between sections
- **Headers**: Bold 18px, consistent hierarchy
- **Body Text**: 14px regular, 16px line height
- **Metrics**: Bold 24px for key numbers
- **Labels**: 12px semibold, uppercase for categories

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Reduced time to find key information
- Faster completion of role-based tasks
- Improved mobile usability scores
- Reduced support tickets about navigation

### Technical Performance
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- Smooth responsive transitions
- No layout shift during data loading
- Accessible to screen readers

## Risk Mitigation

### Development Risks
- **Component Complexity**: Break into smaller, testable pieces
- **Responsive Issues**: Progressive enhancement approach
- **Data Loading**: Implement proper loading states
- **Performance**: Lazy load non-critical components

### User Adoption Risks
- **Change Management**: Gradual rollout with user feedback
- **Training Needs**: In-app guidance and tooltips
